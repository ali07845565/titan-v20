# 🚀 Ultra-Pro-Max Traffic Engine v3.0 (Ali Abbas Special)

This is an advanced, high-performance automated traffic generation engine designed to simulate organic search behavior and high-CPM traffic from **USA and UK**.

## 🌟 Features
- **100x Advanced Logic:** Uses session persistence and behavioral simulation.
- **Organic Search Spoofing:** Simulates traffic from Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and YouTube.
- **Massive IP Rotation:** Dynamically fetches and rotates thousands of elite proxies.
- **Multi-Threaded:** Runs 30+ parallel workers for maximum hit rate.
- **Keyword Integration:** Populates your Blogger "Search Keywords" dashboard with realistic terms.
- **Anti-Detection:** Implements `X-Forwarded-For`, `DNT`, and `Random User-Agents` to bypass filters.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `bot.py`: The main Python engine containing the traffic logic.
- `requirements.txt`: List of necessary Python libraries.
- `Dockerfile`: Configuration for cloud deployment (Koyeb/Heroku/Render).
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🚀 Deployment on Koyeb
1. **Create a GitHub Repo:** Upload all files (`bot.py`, `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`).
2. **Link to Koyeb:** Go to [Koyeb](https://www.koyeb.com/), create a new Service, and select your GitHub repository.
3. **Build:** Koyeb will automatically detect the `Dockerfile` and start the engine.
4. **Monitor:** Check the "Console" or "Logs" tab in Koyeb to see the real-time hits.
